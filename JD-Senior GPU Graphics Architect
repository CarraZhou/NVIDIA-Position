# Senior GPU Graphics Architect #

## What you’ll be doing: ##
•	Investigate and study state-of-the-art real-time rendering techniques and their implementation on GPU, to find performance issues and propose architectural ideas to improve GPU’s performance.
•	Investigate and study state-of-the-art 3D game engines and their support on GPU, to find performance issues and propose architectural ideas to improve GPU’s performance.
•	Study D3D12, DX Machine Learning, DX Ray Tracing and Vulkan APIs and their impact to GPU, to propose architectural ideas to improve GPU’s performance.
•	Investigate and propose GPU graphics architectural ideas to improve performance based on quantitative study of existing and projected architectures.
•	Develop 3D micro-benchmarks applications to study GPU’s performance and propose performance improvement ideas.
•	Develop performance simulation models and simulation infrastructure.
•	Develop performance test plan and tests for new graphics units and architectural features.
•	Debug and triage perf tests on various performance models to identify performance bottlenecks and propose performance improvement ideas.

## What we need to see: ##
•	Proven knowledge of computer science, with the focus on computer graphics and/or computer architecture.
•	Deep understanding of GPU concept and pipeline, in terms of graphics processing and parallel computing.
•	Good mastery of C++ language and at least 5 years of C/C++ development experience.
•	BSEE, BSCSE, or equivalent required. MS or PhD is a good plus.

## Ways to stand out from the crowd: ##
•	Good understanding of state-of-the-art rendering techniques and their usage of GPU.
•	Experience of D3D12 and Vulkan.
•	Experience of performance modelling, profiling and analysis.
•	Candidates with experience of GPU graphics unit design and/or RTL module development are preferred.

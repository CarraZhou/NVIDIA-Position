## What you’ll be doing: ##
- Investigate and study state-of-the-art real-time rendering techniques and their implementation on GPU, to find performance issues and propose architectural ideas to improve GPU’s performance.
- Investigate and study state-of-the-art 3D game engines and their support on GPU, to find performance issues and propose architectural ideas to improve GPU’s performance.
- Study D3D12, DX Machine Learning, DX Ray Tracing and Vulkan APIs and their impact to GPU, to propose architectural ideas to improve GPU’s performance.
- Investigate and propose GPU graphics architectural ideas to improve performance based on quantitative study of existing and projected architectures.
- Develop 3D micro-benchmarks applications to study GPU’s performance and propose performance improvement ideas.
- Develop performance simulation models and simulation infrastructure.
- Develop performance test plan and tests for new graphics units and architectural features.
- Debug and triage perf tests on various performance models to identify performance bottlenecks and propose performance improvement ideas.

## What we need to see: ##
- Proven knowledge of computer science, with the focus on computer graphics and/or computer architecture.
- Deep understanding of GPU concept and pipeline, in terms of graphics processing and parallel computing.
- Good mastery of C++ language and at least 5 years of C/C++ development experience.
- BSEE, BSCSE, or equivalent required. MS or PhD is a good plus.

## Ways to stand out from the crowd: ##
- Good understanding of state-of-the-art rendering techniques and their usage of GPU.
- Experience of D3D12 and Vulkan.
- Experience of performance modelling, profiling and analysis.
- Candidates with experience of GPU graphics unit design and/or RTL module development are preferred.

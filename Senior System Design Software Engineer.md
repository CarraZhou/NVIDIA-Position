A key part of NVIDIA’s strength is our proprietary internal tools for the visualization, analysis, and debug and verification of tests and applications on various functional and performance simulations of our future chips. We are continuously evolving and needing the next generation of tools to enable the future generation of chips. These tools enable hundreds of engineers worldwide to build the world’s most powerful computing chips.

## What you’ll be doing: ##

- You will lead a group of architects to design and develop internal tools which will be used to visualize, analyze, debug and verify tests and different applications on different simulations of future chips.
- Your will need to create alignment between team members and management, make difficult tradeoffs among different teams, plan and execute multiple projects with different divisions. You will need to influence cross teams through clear communication with technical expertise.
- You will have opportunities to participate in state of the art GPU macro- and micro-architecture design, verification and optimization, including porting commercial applications to test benches, identifying performance hot spots and analytics for performance analysis.

## What we need to see: ##
- Bachelor's Degree or higher majoring in CS/EE/Mathematics or related
- Solid computer science background
- Strong C/C++ programming ability.
- Experience in a technical leadership position
- Excellent project management skill
- Effective verbal and written communication skill
- Excellent English writing for engineering documentation, English oral well enough to attend meetings.

## Ways to stand out from the crowd: ##
- Scripting language (Perl, Python, Ruby) experience.
- 3D graphics (D3D or OpenGL) application development.
- Parallel computing/CUDA/OpenCL/HPC development.
- Microprocessor architecture design & verification.
- System level programming experience in OS, compiler, driver, tools, virtual memory system, etc.
- Multimedia (video, image processing, visualization) application development

# [Sr Data Scientist](https://github.com/CarraZhou/NVIDIA-Position/blob/master/NVIDIA-Positions.md) #

Are you interested in solving the most complex data science problems for gaming platforms? As a data scientist in gaming platform team, you would help us understand and drill down into gaming session experience using data. As a Data Scientist will turn data into information, information into insight and insight into business decisions to help optimize the engineering process and align strategic direction. You will work closely with our leadership team, internal partners and engineering,  providing them insight and data that enables effective changes across the organization.
Our projects include user behavior profiling, user base segmentation and campaign targeting, smart per. Our technology stack relies on industry standard open source components (Hadoop/Hive, Spark, ELK, Tableau, Cassandra, Avro, Kafka, Aerospike, Redis, PostgreSQL etc) and proprietary tools implemented in Python, Java/Spring, JavaScript/NodeJS. Are you a talented, visionary and ambitious engineer who can help us grow our solutions for the data analysis for millions of gamers from all over the world?
 
 
## What you will be doing: ##
- Analyze and develop model to address quantitative data on gaming experiences
- Analyze and develop model to address qualitative survey data on gaming experiences
- Apply ML/AI techniques (classification/clustering/sentiment) to solve reliability and QoS issues for our products.
- Develop frameworks for data ingestion and processing
- We want you to extend intelligent approaches to detect and to root cause the outliers in the data models, to identify inconsistencies in data. You will come up with scalable algorithms (for data processing and machine learning) on how to diagnose the root causes of errors.
- You will act as a link, working within and coordinating between multiple distributed teams for end-to-end feature delivery. You will prepare documentation for the processes, policies, data formats, test cases and the expected results within the scope of your projects.

## What we need to see: ##
- Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or statistics or related field
- 7+ years professional experience in software development and building successful production software systems
- 3+ yearsâ€™ experience in solving problems using machine learning algorithms and techniques (clustering, classification, outlier analysis, anomaly detection etc.) and deep learning models (Neural Networks)
- 4+ industrial experience with common tools for data storage and processing (e.g. Spark, Hadoop Map/Reduce, Hive, Cassandra). You will have to drill into the problems of running large-scale software in a big network
- We expect you to have system design/architecture skills to build reliable data flows, combining analytical batch processing and low-latency services. You have passion for efficient algorithms and data structures, advantages/limitations of using them in distributed environments
- Excellent interpersonal, presentation and reporting skills should be your strong sides
- You are a self-motivated, engaged, eager for self-education person with strong self-management skills
- Strong oral and written communication skills in English
 
## Way to stand out from the crowd : ##
- Demonstrated skills as a senior engineer (i.e. mentoring, leading out in product designs, managing projects, architecting products)
- Love for PC/mobile gaming will help you in working with our data sets
- Experience working within a large international team
- Software security experience would be a plus
- Love of technology, especially data analytics, and passionate about what you do
- Strong collaborative and interpersonal skills, specifically a proven ability to effectively guide and influence within a dynamic matrix environment
